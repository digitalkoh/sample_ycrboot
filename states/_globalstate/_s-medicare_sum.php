<p class="programs">Medicare provides health insurance to people who are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Age 65 or older.</li>
	<li>Under age 65 who have permanent disabilities, end-stage renal disease, or Lou Gehrig's disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Medicare Parts A and B cover many&#8211;but not all&#8211;hospital and medical costs. Many people choose to buy extra health insurance.
